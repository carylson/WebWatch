A monitoring and notification class for immediately communicating website outages to a webmaster, or webmaster(s).

Basically, the class simulates a web request to a specified URL and either SMSs, calls, or e-mails any number of website administrators if an error occurs (according to http header status code returned).

Notes:
- To make the most of this application, create a CRON job that automatically  runs the script every so often!
- It's critical to run this application on a separate server from the website(s) you're testing!
